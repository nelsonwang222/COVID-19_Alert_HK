# COVID-19_Alert_HK

#### **1. Analysis of the problem** 
In 2020, COVID-19 has had a strong impact on the world, and Hong Kong has also been hit hard. As the outbreaks of the pandemic repeated frequently and irregularly, in order to effectively control the pandemic situation, the information about the updated cases in the communities is very important for the citizens living in this port city to stay cautious and prevent themselves from getting infected. <br>
However, even though the data collection, recording and analysis have become more and more vital, the degree of difficulty has also become higher. It’s a very challenging task for the news reporters to manage and analyze the pandemic data while they need to cover the latest information to the audience in a short period of time.<br>

#### **2. The topic we cover**
By making full use of the statistics published on the data.gov.hk by the HKSAR government which contained the details of probable/confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in Hong Kong and provided the public with the CSV document of the raw data. We can create an automated content management system to help the news reporters to master the big picture of the data and find more clues from it to tell the deep information to alert the Hong Kong citizens and give them advice to avoid the exposure to the virus.

#### **3. The function of our system** <br>
Our project, COVID-19 Alert HK, mainly includes the following functions: <br>
● Creating the COVID-19_HK Dataset converting it to SQL. <br>
● Generating data reports automatedly which involves several aspects: total number  cases up to date report; daily report; hospitalized/discharged/deceased report; days  with maximum number of cases report. <br>
● Added reported cases by user themselves. <br>
● Visualizing the data.  <br>
